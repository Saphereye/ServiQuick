# Introduction

Welcome to ServiQuik, the quick emergency services calling app developed for the Heremap Hackathon 2023. We are excited to share this project with you, which was not only created for this prestigious event but also earned us a spot among the top 10 participants!

ServiQuik is a user-friendly mobile application designed to provide swift access to emergency services. With just a few taps, you can call for immediate assistance from hospitals, fire stations, or the police. The app employs Text-to-Speech (TTS) technology to convey essential information about the nearest service of your choice and provides a convenient route on the map for your destination.
